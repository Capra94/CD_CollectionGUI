# CD Collection Manager

## Project Description
The CD Collection Manager is a Java based application that allows users to manage their CD collections. Users can add new CDs, update existing entries, remove CDs, and display the entire collection through a graphical user interface (GUI). The project includes both the GUI implementation (`CDCollectionGUI` class) and the logic for managing the CD collection (`CDCollection` class) and the CD class ('CD' class).
